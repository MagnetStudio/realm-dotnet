# AsyncTasks

A basic task management app, designed as a *homage* to [Realmac Software's Clear](http://realmacsoftware.com/clear),
with their knowledge and permission.

In particular, it uses Async techniques as much as possible, to show how that can be used with Realm.

Early drafts of this concentrate more on the internals than on the full UI experience.

The app was created using Xamarin Studio 6.1 with a Forms template using PCL.
